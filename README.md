Show branch logic in a Microsoft Forms form as a diagram

![Forms Diagram Icon](images/icon48.png)

## Rationale

A form created using [Microsoft Forms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/online-surveys-polls-quizzes) can have complex branching logic. This Chrome (and Edge, I suppose) Extension allows that logic to be visualized using a [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/)-generated diagram.

## Disclaimer

This extension was created in October 2022, and uses HTML scraping to parse the branching structure of forms. If the HTML structure or URLs of Microsoft Forms changes, it will probably stop working and need an update.

## Acknowledgements

This extension was created because of prodding by [Dr. Nitin Paranjape](https://efficiency365.com/), [@drnitinp](https://github.com/drnitinp) on GitHub. He came up with the basic requirement, and tested the solution through multiple iterations and refinements.
